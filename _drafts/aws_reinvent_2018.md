# AWS Re:Invent 2018

I was able to attend the AWS Re:Invent 2018 conference last week and there were a few things I learned about how to get the most out of a conference that size and thought I would list them here in case I'm able to attend Re:Invent in the future.

## Tips and Tricks
- Session Scheduling
  - Schedule sessions according to a single venue for at least a morning/afternoon split.  Transportation between venues via the shuttle service takes upwards of an hour so switching venues between relatively closely scheduled sessions is not feasible
- Session Evals
  - Complete a session eval each day of the conference and report back to the Swag/Check-in area to pick up a limited edition pin each day.
- Hardware Announcements
  - If a new piece of hardware is announced in a keynote, sign up for one of the workshops that day.  Chances are anyone who attends that workshop will get a device free of charge to take home.
- Swag
  - You are going to get a ton of swag so pack accordingly.  You probably want at least half of a suitcase free to bring stuff home.  I ended up leaving a few shirts in the hotel room because I simply didn't have the room to bring it home.
