# Hello.  I'm Brad.

I write code.  I write code for my job (by the way...<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/story-beta/bwturner" target="_blank">Developer Story</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/cv-beta/bwturner" target="_blank">Traditional CV</a>).  I write code for my own entertainment.  I write code for family members.  I write code for fun.  When I'm not behind a keyboard, I'm usually outdoors either screaming at one of my favorite sports teams at a game or peacefully fishing from a kayak in Lake Anna.

My hopes for this space is to write about topics I find interesting in the world of software development.  Ready. Go.
